# ConsultEase UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tab Shifting Issue
**Problem**: When tapping the "Request Consultation" button on faculty cards, the consultation request tab and consultation history tab were shifting/moving unexpectedly, creating a jarring user experience.

**Root Cause**: The `animate_tab_change` method was using position-based animations that moved the entire tab widget, causing visual instability.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Improved Tab Animation (lines 1342-1400 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Removed position-based animations** that caused the entire widget to move
- **Replaced with color-based highlight effects** that provide visual feedback without movement
- **Reduced animation duration** from 500ms to 200ms to prevent jarring effects
- **Added immediate tab switching** to prevent delays and ensure stability

#### B. Enhanced Tab Widget Styling (lines 1023-1080 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Added position: relative** to tabs to prevent floating
- **Added position: fixed** to tab bar to prevent movement
- **Removed focus outlines** that could cause shifting
- **Added stable positioning** with top: 0px constraint

#### C. Fixed set_faculty Method (lines 1133-1171 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Replaced jarring animation calls** with direct tab switching
- **Added condition check** to only switch if not already on request tab
- **Implemented subtle highlight effect** without position changes
- **Added error handling** for graceful fallbacks

### 2. Action Buttons Visibility Issue
**Problem**: In the consultation history tab, action buttons were only partially visible - only half of each button could be seen, making them difficult to use.

**Root Cause**: Inadequate column sizing and insufficient row heights in the table widget.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Improved Column Sizing (lines 532-547 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Set Actions column to Fixed width** (180px) instead of ResizeToContents
- **Set minimum section size** to 100px for all columns
- **Configured proper resize modes** for each column type
- **Increased minimum row height** to 50px to accommodate buttons

#### B. Enhanced Button Styling and Layout (lines 748-807 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Set fixed button sizes**: View (60x35px), Cancel (70x35px)
- **Added proper margins and spacing** (5px margins, 8px spacing)
- **Implemented comprehensive button styling** with hover and pressed states
- **Added size policy** (Expanding, Fixed) for proper widget sizing
- **Set minimum cell height** to 40px for button visibility

#### C. Improved Button Container (lines 748-807 in consultation_panel.py)
- **Added stretch layout** to center buttons when only one is present
- **Increased container margins** for better visual separation
- **Added comprehensive CSS styling** for professional appearance
- **Ensured consistent button appearance** across all states
