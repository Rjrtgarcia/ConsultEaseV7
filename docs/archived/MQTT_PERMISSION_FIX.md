# MQTT Permission Fix - ESP32 Cannot Publish Responses

## 🔍 **Issue Confirmed**
- ✅ Central System → ESP32: Working (consultation messages received)
- ❌ ESP32 → Central System: Failing (responses never arrive)
- ✅ MQTT Connection: Stable (state 0 = CONNECTED)

This is **asymmetric MQTT permissions** - ESP32 can subscribe but cannot publish.

## 🚀 **Immediate Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Check MQTT Broker ACL Configuration**

Your MQTT broker likely has Access Control Lists (ACL) that allow:
- ✅ ESP32 to **SUBSCRIBE** to `consultease/faculty/1/messages`
- ❌ ESP32 to **PUBLISH** to `consultease/faculty/1/responses`

**Check your MQTT broker config:**
```bash
# For Mosquitto, check:
/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/acl.conf
# or
/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

# Look for lines like:
user faculty_desk
topic read consultease/faculty/+/messages    # ✅ Can read
topic write consultease/faculty/+/responses  # ❌ Missing this line
```

**Fix:** Add publish permission:
```bash
# Add this line to ACL file:
topic write consultease/faculty/+/responses
```

### **Solution 2: Test with Different Topic**

Try publishing to a test topic to isolate the issue:

**Add to ESP32 code:**
```cpp
// Test different topics in setup()
client.publish("test/faculty1", "hello");           // Simple topic
client.publish("consultease/test", "test");         // Different namespace
client.publish("faculty/1/status", "available");    // Legacy topic
```

### **Solution 3: Use Legacy Topic (Quick Workaround)**

The central system logs show legacy topic working. Modify ESP32 to use legacy topic:

**Change in ESP32:**
```cpp
// Instead of:
// client.publish("consultease/faculty/1/responses", responseJson.c_str());

// Use:
client.publish("faculty/1/responses", responseJson.c_str());
// or
client.publish("professor/responses", responseJson.c_str());
```

### **Solution 4: MQTT Broker User Permissions**

Check if the `faculty_desk` user has proper permissions:

```bash
# Test with mosquitto_pub command:
mosquitto_pub -h 172.20.10.8 -p 1883 -u faculty_desk -P desk_password \
  -t "consultease/faculty/1/responses" \
  -m '{"test":"response","faculty_id":1}'

# If this fails, the user lacks publish permission
```

## 🔧 **Most Likely Fix: Update MQTT Broker ACL**

**For Mosquitto broker, add to ACL file:**
```
# Faculty desk units
user faculty_desk
topic read consultease/faculty/+/messages
topic write consultease/faculty/+/responses     # ← ADD THIS LINE
topic write consultease/faculty/+/status
topic write consultease/faculty/+/heartbeat
```

**Restart MQTT broker:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

After updating permissions:

1. **ESP32 should show:**
   ```
   ✅ MQTT publish reported SUCCESS
   ```

2. **Central system should receive:**
   ```
   🔥 FACULTY RESPONSE HANDLER TRIGGERED
   ✅ Successfully updated consultation status: 1 (PENDING -> BUSY)
   ```

## 📋 **Alternative Diagnosis**

If ACL isn't the issue, check:

1. **Network firewall** blocking outbound MQTT from ESP32
2. **MQTT broker overload** (check broker logs)
3. **Different authentication** for publish vs subscribe

The asymmetric behavior (can receive but can't send) strongly points to **broker ACL configuration** as the root cause.
